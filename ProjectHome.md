Have you ever wanted to sync metadata with flickr.com?

Requires [FlickrNet.dll](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=FlickrNet) in bin folder. (Version 2.1.5)

Special thanks to [Erwyn van der Meer](http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/erwyn/), whose own project called [FlickrMetadataSynchr](http://www.codeplex.com/FlickrMetadataSynchr) greatly assisted my efforts. Note: if you are not a programmer, use Erwyn's program. My project has been optimized for my particular needs and is not particularly stable for general use at the moment.

Also requires Windows Media Player to play the videos.
